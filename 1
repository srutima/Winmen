**Retrieve the full name of employees along with their department names:** sql SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, d.department_name FROM employees e JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id; 
2. **Calculate the average salary for each department:** sql SELECT d.department_name, AVG(s.salary) AS average_salary FROM employees e JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id JOIN salaries s ON e.employee_id = s.employee_id GROUP BY d.department_name;
3. **Find the employee with the highest salary:** sql SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, s.salary FROM employees e JOIN salaries s ON e.employee_id = s.employee_id WHERE s.salary = (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM salaries);
4. **Identify employees who joined after a specific date:** sql SELECT first_name, last_name, hire_date FROM employees WHERE hire_date > 'specific_date_here'; 5. **Determine the total salary expenses for each department for a given period:** sql SELECT d.department_name, SUM(s.salary) AS total_salary_expenses FROM employees e JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id JOIN salaries s ON e.employee_id = s.employee_id WHERE s.from_date >= 'start_date_here' AND s.to_date <= 'end_date_here' GROUP BY d.department_name;
