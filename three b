 1. **Find the total number of students enrolled in each course:** sql SELECT c.course_id, c.course_name, COUNT(e.student_id) AS total_students_enrolled FROM courses c LEFT JOIN enrollments e ON c.course_id = e.course_id GROUP BY c.course_id, c.course_name;
2. **List the courses taught by professors in the 'Computer Science' department:** sql SELECT c.course_id, c.course_name FROM courses c JOIN professors p ON c.professor_id = p.professor_id WHERE p.department = 'Computer Science';
3. **Calculate the average grade for each course:** sql SELECT c.course_id, c.course_name, AVG(e.grade) AS average_grade FROM courses c JOIN enrollments e ON c.course_id = e.course_id GROUP BY c.course_id, c.course_name;
4. **Find students who are enrolled in more than three courses:** sql SELECT student_id, COUNT(DISTINCT course_id) AS total_courses_enrolled FROM enrollments GROUP BY student_id HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT course_id) > 3;
